ðŸª“ Uglier

    "Have you ever looked at some code and thought, 'Wow, this is so clean and readable!'? Well, good news, random citizenâ€¦
    Not anymore."

Introducing Uglier â€” a web abomination inspired by the beloved VS Code extension, Prettier. But unlike Prettier, which formats your code into something beautiful and readable, Uglier does the exact opposite.

Meet our delightful mascot: an experienced executioner. Uglier mutilates your code, yet somehow keeps it alive and running! The result? A monstrosity that would make even the most battle-hardened developers claw at their eyes in agony.
